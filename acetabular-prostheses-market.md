<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acetabular Prostheses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cementless</li><li>Cemented</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The acetabular prostheses market is divided primarily into cemented and cementless types. Cemented prostheses involve the use of bone cement to secure the implant, providing immediate fixation and stability, often preferred in older patients with weaker bones. Conversely, cementless prostheses rely on a porous surface that encourages bone ingrowth for long-term stability, making them suitable for younger, more active patients. The choice between these types depends on patient age, bone quality, and activity level, influencing surgical outcomes and prosthesis longevity.</p></p>
