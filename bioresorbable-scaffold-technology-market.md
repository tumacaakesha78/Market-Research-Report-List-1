<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bioresorbable Scaffold Technology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metal Bioresorbable Scaffold</li><li>Polymer Bioresorbable Scaffold</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bioresorbable scaffold technology market consists of two primary types: metal bioresorbable scaffolds and polymer bioresorbable scaffolds. Metal bioresorbable scaffolds are composed of materials like magnesium or iron, providing high strength and support during the healing process, dissolving over time. In contrast, polymer bioresorbable scaffolds utilize materials such as polylactic acid, which are lighter and more flexible but may have lower mechanical strength. Both types aim to provide temporary support for tissue regeneration while eliminating the need for subsequent removal procedures.</p></p>
