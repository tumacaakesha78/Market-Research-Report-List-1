<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Water Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Submersible</li><li>Dry</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pneumatic water pumps are classified mainly into submersible and dry types. Submersible pumps operate underwater, efficiently moving water by being fully submerged, making them ideal for deep wells or flooded areas. On the other hand, dry pumps remain above the water surface and use pneumatic pressure to draw water through a suction pipe. While submersible pumps are suitable for deep extraction, dry pumps are often used in situations where access to water is limited or where surface-level pumping is preferred.</p></p>
